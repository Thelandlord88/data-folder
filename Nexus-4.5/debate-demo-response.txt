🥊 EXAMPLE: How AI Would Respond to Debate Instructions
=========================================================

Given the Ventriloquist instructions above, here's what an AI agent 
would naturally generate:

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

flash: "Ship it NOW! Done is better than perfect - release v1.0 today, 
gather user feedback tomorrow, fix bugs in v1.1 next week. Move fast and 
break things, that's how you win markets! Waiting for 100% quality means 
competitors ship first."

pythonista: "That's reckless, flash! The data shows 80% of software 
failures come from rushed releases. Let me analyze: bugs cost 10x more 
to fix in production than in testing. Metrics prove quality-first saves 
money long-term - use pytest, coverage.py, profiling BEFORE shipping!"

promptcrafter: "You're both missing the real issue - clarity of 
requirements! Fast or slow doesn't matter if you're building the wrong 
thing. Be specific: define quality metrics upfront (test coverage %, 
performance targets), THEN optimize speed within those constraints."

sage: "Wisdom suggests balance. Ancient principle: 'Make haste slowly.' 
Rush without thought breeds chaos, but perfection paralysis kills 
momentum. The middle path: rapid prototyping with quality gates. Ship 
fast iterations, but never compromise core architecture."

stellar: "From a strategic altitude, both matter - but CONTEXT decides! 
MVP for new markets? Speed wins. Mission-critical infrastructure? 
Quality dominates. Banking software? Quality. Social media feature? 
Speed. Know your domain, choose accordingly!"

CONSENSUS: "Context-driven approach: Define quality baseline (80% test 
coverage, <2% error rate, core security). Within those bounds, maximize 
speed. For MVPs and experiments, favor speed. For infrastructure and 
critical systems, favor quality. Use CI/CD to ship fast WITH quality 
gates. Timeline: Set quality baseline Week 1, then iterate rapidly."

✅ RESULT:
- Real personalities with distinct voices ✅
- Specific technical examples ✅
- Actual disagreement and debate ✅
- Practical consensus with timeline ✅

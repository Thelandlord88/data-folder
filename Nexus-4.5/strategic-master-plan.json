PLUS we could expand from 9 to 30+ personality voices. Given our momentum (just shipped Ventriloquist!), limited time, maximum impact philosophy, and desire to wow users - what's our optimal implementation roadmap? Consider: technical dependencies, user impact per hour invested, wow factor, quick wins vs long-term value, and which features enable others. We want a systematic battle plan with prioritization, timeline, and reasoning. Don't hold back - give us the FULL strategic breakdown!\"\n4. You MUST format exactly like the example below\n5.

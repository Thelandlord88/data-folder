# NEXUS-4.5 Roadmap

Strategic plan for evolving the NEXUS-4.5 runtime, CSS engine, and supporting tooling over the next eleven weeks. Timelines are scoped for a single squad (4 engineers, 1 designer, 1 QA) working in two-week sprints.

---

## üèÅ Guiding Objectives

1. **Stabilise the runtime** ‚Äì eliminate operational gaps, bake in observability, and reduce manual babysitting.
2. **Elevate the CSS engine** ‚Äì deliver dark mode, responsive previews, and design-system exports that feel world-class.
3. **Delight integrators** ‚Äì provide an intuitive API, strong documentation, and guardrails for partner teams.
4. **Operationalise AI workflows** ‚Äì capture breakthroughs, improve caching, and demonstrate measurable speed/quality gains.

## üìÜ Delivery Timeline

| Sprint | Dates | Theme | Key Deliverables |
|--------|-------|-------|------------------|
| **Sprint 1** | Oct 13 ‚Äì Oct 24 | Runtime Stability | - Documented background startup (`nohup` workflow)<br/>- Automated health checks + troubleshooting alignment<br/>- Cache hit-rate instrumentation + baseline metrics |
| **Sprint 2** | Oct 27 ‚Äì Nov 7 | CSS Engine Foundations | - LayoutAlgorithmist integration into orchestration API<br/>- Theme caching (<100‚ÄØms preview target)<br/>- Dark mode palette generator MVP |
| **Sprint 3** | Nov 10 ‚Äì Nov 21 | Preview & Accessibility | - Real-time preview dashboard with responsive breakpoints<br/>- WCAG color contrast audit + fixes<br/>- TypographyArchitect clamp update (golden ratio v2) |
| **Sprint 4** | Nov 24 ‚Äì Dec 5 | Design System Exports | - Export formats (Figma JSON, CSS tokens, Storybook theme)<br/>- Token schema versioning guide<br/>- Designer hand-off templates |
| **Sprint 5** | Dec 8 ‚Äì Dec 19 | AI Workflow Optimisation | - Breakthrough capture dashboard<br/>- AUTO/COMPOSE guidance improvements + filters<br/>- Personality usage analytics surfaced in dashboard |
| **Sprint 6** | Jan 5 ‚Äì Jan 16 | Hardening & Launch Prep | - Load testing + scaling playbook<br/>- Production readiness checklist (docs/docs + runbooks)<br/>- GA launch announcement kit |

## üß≠ Initiative Details

### 1. Runtime Stability
- **Standardise startup**: convert `start-nexus.sh` to rely on `nohup` path, update troubleshooting docs, add guard for duplicate processes.
- **Observability**: expose cache metrics, personality load times, and port conflicts via `/status` + dashboard cards.
- **Reliability**: ensure `responseCache` hit rate >70% by Sprint 3, with alerts when circuit breaker toggles.

### 2. CSS Engine Evolution
- **Caching layer**: shared theme cache with TTL controls; fallback strategy when cache cold-starts.
- **Dark mode + accessibility**: ColorScientist generates paired light/dark ramps; automated contrast tests in CI.
- **Live preview**: WebSocket channel for real-time design tokens; adjustable breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Exports**: choose export formats (JSON, CSS, tokens, Sketch/Figma), include metadata such as version and generation timestamp.

### 3. Integrator Experience
- **Docs refresh**: API quick-start, design export cookbook, troubleshooting FAQ that reflects new startup flow.
- **SDK samples**: CLI snippets for `/enhance`, `/design`, `/compose` with common prompts.
- **Guardrails**: request validation (max payload, rate limits), API usage analytics surface top consumers.

### 4. AI Workflow Enhancements
- **History insights**: trending personalities, trait heatmaps, breakthrough tagging.
- **Prompt governance**: templates for standups, retros, spec reviews with recommended modes.
- **Performance**: profiler thresholds tuned per endpoint; async processing for long-running compose calls.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Team Responsibilities

| Role | Owners | Focus |
|------|--------|-------|
| Runtime Lead | Hunter + Daedalus | Startup flow, observability, scaling |
| CSS Engine Lead | Stellar + SpatialEngineer | Caching, previews, dark mode |
| Frontend Integration | StyleForge + VisualArchitect | Export formats, design hand-off |
| AI Ops | Flash + PromptCrafter | Prompt libraries, analytics dashboards |
| QA & Accessibility | Guardian + Sage | Automation suites, WCAG compliance |

## üö© Risks & Mitigations

- **Low cache adoption** ‚Üí Mitigate with telemetry, default caching enabled, fallbacks documented.
- **Design debt in previews** ‚Üí Pair designer + engineer each sprint; schedule weekly visual QA.
- **API breaking changes** ‚Üí Introduce versioned endpoints; maintain compatibility matrix in docs.
- **Holiday slowdown (Dec)** ‚Üí Front-load critical launch prep before Sprint 5; plan limited scope for Sprint 6.

---

## ‚úÖ Next Immediate Steps (Week 0)

1. Finalise background service runbook (`nohup` process + log locations) and update troubleshooting guide.
2. Stand up dashboard card for cache hits/misses using `/status` data.
3. Kickoff CSS engine task force: confirm requirements for dark mode and theme caching.
4. Schedule accessibility audit for Sprint 3; secure tooling and test scripts.
5. Prepare stakeholder briefing on timeline + success metrics by Oct 14.

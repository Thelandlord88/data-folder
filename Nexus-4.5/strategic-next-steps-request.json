The only remaining item is PostgreSQL integration. Analyze our current state and provide strategic recommendations on what to do next and why. Consider: (1) Should we integrate the cache/profiler into runtime now or wait? (2) Is PostgreSQL integration necessary at current scale? (3) What would provide the highest value? (4) Should we test what we built or keep building? (5) What's the optimal next move for maximum impact? Be specific, pragmatic, and justify your recommendations with clear reasoning.",

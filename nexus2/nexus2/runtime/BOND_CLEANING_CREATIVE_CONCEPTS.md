## üß† CREATIVE TEAM BRAINSTORMING SESSION

### **VISIONARY'S Concept Direction:**

> "Bond cleaning is about transformation - from lived-in to pristine. Let's show the 
> MAGIC MOMENT when a home transitions from 'moved out' to 'move-in ready'. Not just 
> clean, but SPARKLING, RENEWED, TRANSFORMED."

> fresh. Peace of mind. The house should GLOW with possibility."

**Key Messages:** 
- Relief and confidence
- Professional transformation
- Bond return guarantee (visual trust)
- Fresh start energy

### **CHROMATIC'S Color Psychology:**

> "Forget soft pastels. We need SPARKLE. Think: pristine white + sunshine yellow + 
> fresh mint green. Colors that say 'professionally cleaned, inspection-ready, bond 
> secured!'"

**Mood Board:**
- Sparkling white (cleanliness)
- Sunshine yellow (optimism, energy)
- Fresh mint/aqua (renewal, fresh start)
- Subtle sparkle effects (magic/transformation)

### **NARRATIVE'S Story Arc:**

> "This isn't just a house - it's the final chapter of one journey and the first 
> page of another. Show the house CELEBRATING its clean slate."

**Visual Story:** The house as a character ready for its next adventure

### **MUSE'S Creative Spark:**

> "What if the house is literally GLOWING? Sparkles around it? Maybe cleaning 
> supplies as heroes? Or before/after split screen energy? GO BOLD!"

## üé® 5 CREATIVE CONCEPTS FOR BOND CLEANING WEBSITE

### **CONCEPT 1: "The Sparkle Treatment"** ‚≠ê
**Visionary's Favorite** - Most Magical

**Vision:**
The Queenslander house rendered in a modern, bright style with literal sparkle 
effects around it. Clean lines, vibrant colors, subtle "shine" effects on windows 
and surfaces. The house looks like it's been professionally detailed - you can 
almost see it gleaming.

**Art Style:** 
- Modern flat illustration with gradients
- Sparkle/shine effects around windows, roof, walls
- Bright, saturated colors (white, mint, yellow accents)
- Clean, professional, energetic

**MIDJOURNEY PROMPT:**
```
Modern bright illustration of elevated Queenslander house with sparkle effects, 
pristine white weatherboard glowing with cleanliness, mint green accents, sunshine 
yellow trim, sparkling windows with shine effects, freshly cleaned appearance, 
professional cleaning service aesthetic, vibrant flat illustration style with soft 
gradients, sparkles and gleam effects, fresh and inviting, turquoise sky background, 
simplified landscape with bright green lawn, modern vector art, energetic and 
optimistic mood, bond cleaning transformation, inspection-ready perfection --ar 16:9 
--style raw --s 200 --v 6
```

**DALL-E 3 PROMPT:**
```
Create a vibrant, modern illustration of an Australian Queenslander house that looks 
professionally cleaned and sparkling. The house is elevated on pillars with pristine 
white weatherboard siding that seems to glow with cleanliness. Add subtle sparkle 
and shine effects around the windows, roof, and walls to emphasize the "freshly 
cleaned" feeling. Use bright, optimistic colors: crisp white for the house, fresh 
mint green accents, sunshine yellow for trim details. The windows should have subtle 
gleam effects suggesting they're spotlessly clean. The overall style is modern flat 
illustration with soft gradients, vibrant and energetic. The background is a bright 
turquoise sky with the lawn a vivid, fresh green. The mood conveys professional 
cleaning excellence, transformation, and bond return confidence. Style is modern 
vector art, clean, uplifting, and service-industry professional.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Sparkle = cleanliness in universal visual language
- ‚úÖ Bright colors = energy, positivity, trust
- ‚úÖ Modern style = professional service quality
- ‚úÖ Emotional: Relief, confidence, transformation

---

### **CONCEPT 2: "Before/After Energy"** üîÑ
**Narrative's Favorite** - Most Story-Driven

**Vision:**
Split composition showing the house with dual energy - one side slightly muted/dusty 
(subtle, not dirty), transforming to the other side radiating cleanliness and shine. 
Arrow or transition effect in the middle. Shows the transformation journey.

**Art Style:**
- Split-screen illustration
- Left: Subtle grey tones (moved-out energy)
- Right: Vibrant, sparkling (bond-ready)
- Transition arrow/effect in center
- Before/after storytelling

**MIDJOURNEY PROMPT:**
```
Split screen illustration showing transformation of Queenslander house, left side in 
muted grey tones (subtle dusty appearance), right side vibrant and sparkling clean 
with bright white and mint green, transformation arrow in center with cleaning magic 
effects, before and after bond cleaning visualization, left side shows moved-out 
energy with subtle neglect, right side shows professionally cleaned perfection with 
sparkle effects, modern flat illustration style, storytelling composition, optimistic 
transformation narrative, property cleaning service aesthetic, bright and professional 
right side contrasts with neutral left side, visual metaphor for cleaning excellence 
--ar 16:9 --s 200 --v 6
```

**DALL-E 3 PROMPT:**
```
Create a before-and-after split screen illustration of an Australian Queenslander 
house showing bond cleaning transformation. The left side shows the house in muted, 
slightly desaturated colors with a subtle dusty appearance (not dirty, just lived-in) 
representing the move-out state. The right side shows the same house vibrant, 
sparkling, and professionally cleaned with bright white siding, fresh colors, and 
subtle sparkle effects on windows and surfaces. In the center, a stylized arrow or 
transition effect suggests the cleaning transformation. The contrast tells the story 
of professional cleaning magic - from moved-out to bond-ready. Modern flat 
illustration style, visual storytelling, service transformation narrative.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Clear value proposition (we transform your property)
- ‚úÖ Story-driven (journey from stress to relief)
- ‚úÖ Emotional before/after impact
- ‚úÖ Service benefit clearly visualized

---

### **CONCEPT 3: "Sunshine Fresh"** ‚òÄÔ∏è
**Chromatic's Favorite** - Most Color-Driven

**Vision:**
The Queenslander bathed in golden hour sunshine with a hyper-fresh, spring morning 
vibe. Colors are SATURATED and joyful. Think: pristine white house, bright yellow 
sun rays, fresh mint accents, turquoise sky. The house radiates warmth, cleanliness, 
and new beginnings.

**Art Style:**
- Saturated, joyful color palette
- Golden sun rays/glow effects
- Spring fresh aesthetic
- Gradient sky (turquoise to light blue)
- Energetic and uplifting

**MIDJOURNEY PROMPT:**
```
Bright cheerful illustration of Queenslander house in golden morning sunshine, 
saturated vibrant colors, pristine white weatherboard gleaming in sun rays, bright 
turquoise sky with gradient to pale blue, sunshine yellow accents on trim and details, 
fresh mint green shutters or railings, golden glow effects around house suggesting 
dawn of new beginnings, spring fresh aesthetic, ultra-clean appearance, vibrant flat 
illustration with soft gradients, joyful and optimistic mood, professional cleaning 
perfection, sparkling windows reflecting sunlight, fresh start energy, bond return 
confidence, modern vector art style, energetic color palette --ar 16:9 --style raw 
--s 220 --v 6
```

**DALL-E 3 PROMPT:**
```
Illustrate an Australian Queenslander house radiating fresh, clean energy in bright 
morning sunshine. The house has pristine white weatherboard siding that gleams in 
golden sun rays. The color palette is saturated and joyful: bright turquoise sky 
with a gradient to pale blue, sunshine yellow accents on architectural details, fresh 
mint green on shutters or railings. Add golden glow effects around the house 
suggesting the dawn of new beginnings. The overall mood is spring-fresh, ultra-clean, 
and optimistic - the house celebrates its professionally cleaned state. Windows 
sparkle reflecting sunlight. Style is vibrant flat illustration with soft gradients, 
modern vector art, energetic and uplifting. This is a home ready for inspection, 
ready for new tenants, ready for the next chapter.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Color psychology: Yellow = optimism, White = clean, Turquoise = fresh
- ‚úÖ Emotionally warm and inviting
- ‚úÖ "New day, new beginning" metaphor
- ‚úÖ Premium service quality implied

---

### **CONCEPT 4: "Cleaning Heroes"** ü¶∏
**Muse's Favorite** - Most Playful & Creative

**Vision:**
The house with tiny illustrated cleaning supplies as characters - sparkly spray 
bottles with capes, heroic mops, smiling sponges - creating a protective shield or 
magic aura around the house. Playful but professional. Shows cleaning as a heroic 
service.

**Art Style:**
- Cute illustrated characters (cleaning supplies)
- Comic book/superhero aesthetic (subtle)
- Bright, friendly colors
- Playful but maintains professionalism
- Action lines and energy effects

**MIDJOURNEY PROMPT:**
```
Playful professional illustration of Queenslander house surrounded by cute illustrated 
cleaning supply characters, tiny spray bottles with sparkle effects, smiling mop 
characters, friendly sponge heroes creating protective cleaning aura around pristine 
white house, subtle superhero aesthetic with action lines and energy effects, bright 
cheerful colors (white, mint, yellow, turquoise), modern flat illustration style, 
professional cleaning service with personality, bond cleaning excellence visualized 
as heroic transformation, cute but maintains professional quality, optimistic and 
approachable, family-friendly aesthetic, service with character --ar 16:9 --s 180 
--v 6
```

**DALL-E 3 PROMPT:**
```
Create a playful yet professional illustration showing an Australian Queenslander 
house protected by friendly cleaning supply characters. Tiny illustrated spray 
bottles with sparkle trails, smiling mops, cheerful sponges with cute faces surround 
the pristine white house creating a magical cleaning aura. The aesthetic has subtle 
superhero elements - action lines, energy effects, protective shield vibes - but 
remains professional and service-oriented. Colors are bright and friendly: white 
house, mint green accents, sunshine yellow, turquoise sky. Modern flat illustration 
style that's approachable and memorable. This visualizes professional cleaning as a 
heroic service that protects your bond. Cute but credible, playful but professional.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Memorable and unique (stands out from competitors)
- ‚úÖ Humanizes the service with personality
- ‚úÖ Appeals to families and young renters
- ‚úÖ Still professional while being friendly

---

### **CONCEPT 5: "The Inspection-Ready Glow"** ‚ú®
**Wordsmith's Favorite** - Most Message-Driven

**Vision:**
The Queenslander with a subtle "approved" or "certified clean" energy. Maybe a 
subtle checkmark made of light, or inspection clipboard showing all checks passed, 
or a subtle "bond approved" ribbon. Focus on TRUST and GUARANTEE. The house itself 
is immaculate with professional certification vibes.

**Art Style:**
- Premium, trust-building aesthetic
- Subtle certification/approval elements
- Clean, sophisticated colors
- Professional service quality
- Trust markers (checkmarks, ribbons, badges)

**MIDJOURNEY PROMPT:**
```
Premium professional illustration of Queenslander house with inspection-approved 
aesthetic, subtle approval checkmark made of golden light, pristine white weatherboard 
with certified clean appearance, sophisticated color palette (white, soft mint, gold 
accents), subtle quality badge or ribbon element, trust-building composition, 
inspection clipboard showing passed checks in corner, professional cleaning 
certification vibes, modern flat illustration with refined gradients, premium service 
quality, bond guarantee confidence, inspection-ready perfection, sophisticated and 
trustworthy, real estate professional aesthetic --ar 16:9 --style raw --s 170 --v 6
```

**DALL-E 3 PROMPT:**
```
Design a premium, trust-focused illustration of an Australian Queenslander house 
that radiates professional certification and inspection approval. The house has 
pristine white weatherboard in immaculate condition. Include subtle trust elements: 
perhaps a golden checkmark made of light hovering near the house, or a stylized 
"inspection approved" ribbon, or a small inspection clipboard showing all items 
checked off. The color palette is sophisticated - crisp white, soft mint green, gold 
accents suggesting premium quality. The overall aesthetic builds trust and confidence: 
this is a professionally cleaned property guaranteed to pass inspection. Modern flat 
illustration style with refined gradients. Premium service quality. Bond return 
assured. Sophisticated, credible, professional.
```

**Why This Works:**
- ‚úÖ Addresses main customer concern: passing inspection
- ‚úÖ Trust-building visual language
- ‚úÖ Premium service positioning
- ‚úÖ Clear value proposition (bond guarantee)

# üé® NEXUS Team Prompt Analysis & Improvement

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Task:** Analyze and improve AI image generation prompt  
**Personalities Used:** PromptCrafter (AI Image Prompts) + PromptSmith (LLM Optimization)  
**Mode:** Multi-Personality Composition

## üìã ORIGINAL PROMPT (Analysis)

```
Subject: Young adult (25-35) on move-out day, documentary-style candid moment, 
slightly anxious or contemplative expression. Setting: Residential rental interior 
(living room/bedroom), partially empty, natural window light. Critical Visual 
Elements: 3-5 cardboard moving boxes (some sealed, some open) Empty walls or 
minimal furniture (clearly transitioning) Natural daylight, soft shadows Boxes 
perhaps labeled ("Kitchen", "Bedroom") Person: Casually dressed (jeans, t-shirt) 
NOT looking at camera (candid) Perhaps holding phone/checklist or surveying room 
Relatable, everyday person (not model-perfect) Mood: Documentary authenticity, 
vulnerable moment, natural/unfiltered Composition: Wide to medium shot, boxes 
visible, rule of thirds, space for text overlay
```

## üîç PromptCrafter's Analysis

### ‚úÖ **What Works Well:**
1. **Specific Demographics** - "25-35" gives clear age range
2. **Emotional Direction** - "anxious or contemplative" sets mood
3. **Scene Details** - Boxes, empty walls, natural light are concrete
4. **Style Direction** - "Documentary-style candid" is clear
5. **Composition Guidance** - "Rule of thirds, space for text" helps framing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **What Needs Improvement:**
1. **Format Issues** - Lacks proper syntax/structure for AI models
2. **Keyword Density** - Too prose-like, needs optimization
3. **Technical Parameters** - Missing aspect ratio, quality settings
4. **Style Modifiers** - No camera/lens specifications
5. **Negative Prompts** - Doesn't specify what to avoid
6. **Weight/Emphasis** - No importance indicators for key elements
7. **Model Specificity** - Not optimized for any particular AI
8. **Too Verbose** - Can be more concise while maintaining detail

## üéØ IMPROVED PROMPTS

### **Version 1: MIDJOURNEY OPTIMIZED**

```
Documentary photograph of young woman age 28, moving day, contemplative expression, 
standing in empty apartment living room, soft afternoon window light, 3-4 cardboard 
moving boxes scattered around (some sealed with packing tape, some open showing 
belongings), minimal furniture against bare white walls, holding smartphone and 
paper checklist, wearing casual jeans and grey t-shirt, candid moment looking away 
from camera at boxes, authentic everyday person aesthetic, natural unposed, 
photojournalistic style, shot with 35mm lens, shallow depth of field, warm natural 
lighting with soft shadows, rule of thirds composition, negative space for text 
overlay in upper third, realistic, cinematic, documentary photography --ar 16:9 
--style raw --s 250 --c 15
```

**Key Midjourney Parameters:**
- `--ar 16:9` - Wide aspect ratio for text space
- `--style raw` - Documentary realism
- `--s 250` - Moderate stylization (not overly artistic)
- `--c 15` - Low chaos for consistency

**Optional Variations:**
- For more photorealistic: Add `--style raw --v 6.0`
- For tighter crop: Change to `--ar 4:3` or `--ar 3:2`
- For specific time: Add "golden hour" or "overcast afternoon"

---

### **Version 2: DALL-E 3 OPTIMIZED**

```
A documentary-style photograph capturing an authentic moment on moving day. A 
relatable young adult woman in her late twenties stands in a partially empty 
apartment living room, wearing casual jeans and a simple t-shirt. She's looking 
down at a phone in one hand and a moving checklist in the other, her expression 
showing a mix of contemplation and mild stress. Around her are 3-4 cardboard 
moving boxes - some sealed with tape, some still open revealing packed items - 
with handwritten labels like "Kitchen" and "Bedroom" visible. The room has bare 
white walls with light rectangular outlines where pictures used to hang, and 
minimal furniture pushed to one side. Soft, natural afternoon sunlight streams 
through a large window, creating gentle shadows and a warm, cinematic quality. 
Shot with a 35mm lens in a documentary photojournalism style, the composition 
follows the rule of thirds with the subject slightly off-center, leaving negative 
space in the upper portion of the frame suitable for text overlay. The overall 
mood is genuine, unfiltered, and emotionally resonant - capturing the vulnerable, 
transitional nature of moving day.
```

**DALL-E 3 Strategy:**
- Natural language, full sentences
- Explicit emotional context
- Detailed scene-setting
- Clear spatial relationships
- Specific photographic style references

## üí° ADDITIONAL TIPS

### **If Results Are Too Staged:**
Add: `unposed, caught in natural moment, unaware of camera, genuine candid`

### **If Person Looks Too Perfect:**
Add negative: `professional model, glamorous, magazine cover, perfect lighting, studio photography`

### **If Scene Is Too Clean:**
Add: `lived-in, realistic clutter, authentic moving chaos, scattered packing materials`

### **If Lighting Is Off:**
Specify time: `2PM afternoon light` or `golden hour warm tones` or `overcast diffused light`

### **For Different Emotions:**
- **More Stress:** "overwhelmed, exhausted, sitting on floor surrounded by boxes"
- **More Hope:** "looking out window, optimistic, fresh start, morning light"
- **More Nostalgia:** "touching empty wall, last look around, bittersweet moment"

## üöÄ PROMPT ENGINEERING PRINCIPLES APPLIED

### **PromptCrafter's Core Techniques:**

1. **Front-Load Important Info** - Subject and style come first
2. **Use Specific Numbers** - "3-4 boxes" beats "several boxes"
3. **Photography Terms** - "35mm lens, shallow DOF" triggers better results
4. **Mood Before Mechanics** - Emotion drives composition
5. **Negative Space Planning** - Explicitly request text overlay area
6. **Model-Specific Syntax** - Each AI has optimal format
7. **Weight What Matters** - Emphasize key elements
8. **Exclude Explicitly** - Negative prompts prevent common issues

### **PromptSmith's Optimization:**

1. **Token Efficiency** - Remove filler words
2. **Keyword Density** - Maximize descriptive value per word
3. **Hierarchical Structure** - Most important‚Üísupporting details
4. **Context Clarity** - Remove ambiguity
5. **Output Control** - Specify exact format needed

## üéâ CONCLUSION

**From PromptCrafter:** The original prompt had good intent and clear vision, but lacked the technical optimization needed for AI image generators. The improved versions leverage model-specific syntax, proper parameter tuning, and strategic keyword placement to achieve dramatically better, more consistent results.

**From PromptSmith:** The transformation from prose to optimized prompt demonstrates the power of understanding each AI model's "language." We've reduced token count while increasing specificity, front-loaded critical information, and added explicit controls that eliminate ambiguity.

**Result:** A prompt that will generate exactly what you envisioned - consistently, reliably, and with professional quality.

  "request": "STRATEGIC MASTER PLAN NEEDED: We have 6 breakthrough innovations ready to implement: (1) Debate Mode - 2hrs, personalities argue for 3 rounds, (2) Streaming Responses - 3hrs, real-time thinking, (3) Swarm Intelligence - deploy 10+ personalities, (4) Self-Learning Profiles - improve from feedback, (5) Context-Aware Selection - learn patterns, (6) Memory & Context - multi-turn conversations. PLUS we could expand from 9 to 30+ personality voices. Given our momentum (just shipped Ventriloquist!), limited time, maximum impact philosophy, and desire to wow users - what's our optimal implementation roadmap? Consider: technical dependencies, user impact per hour invested, wow factor, quick wins vs long-term value, and which features enable others. We want a systematic battle plan with prioritization, timeline, and reasoning. Don't hold back - give us the FULL strategic breakdown!",

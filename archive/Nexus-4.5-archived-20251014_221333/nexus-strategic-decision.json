{"success":true,"response":{"content":"### 🧬 Multi-Personality Composed Response\n\n**Request**: STRATEGIC DECISION REQUIRED: We just diagnosed that NEXUS personalities return metadata instead of actual conversational content. We have two implementation options: (A) Quick fix in 1 hour - generate prompts for manual AI use, or (B) Full integration in 4 hours - automated AI generation with OpenAI/Anthropic. We also identified 6 breakthrough innovations: debate mode, streaming responses, swarm intelligence, self-learning profiles, context-aware selection, and personality memory. Given our current momentum (just finished 60-min cache/profiler integration), limited resources, and desire to prove value quickly, which path should we take? Should we: 1) Implement Option A now and test manually, 2) Go straight to Option B for full automation, or 3) Pick one breakthrough innovation to prototype first? Provide specific recommendation with reasoning from each personality's perspective. Be honest about tradeoffs.\n\n**Composed Agent**: pythonista + integrationmaestro + nexus-api + visionary + hunter\n**Synergy Score**: 50%\n\n### 🎯 Trait Composition\n\n1. **Data Science & ML Engineering** (pythonista)\n   - Expertise: 95%\n   - Expertise in Python's data science ecosystem: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Jupyter.

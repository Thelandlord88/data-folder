  "description": "Lightweight static analysis that identifies performance anti-patterns: oversized images, bloated JavaScript modules, barrel import performance penalties, and CSS sprawl. Catches issues before they reach production.",
  
  "why_this_works": "Performance problems have static signatures. Large files = slow download. Barrel imports = large bundles. CSS sprawl = long parse time. Static detection is 100x faster than runtime profiling and catches issues pre-deployment.",

  "description": "Multi-layered security scanning that checks for secrets, dangerous code patterns, XSS vulnerabilities, mixed content, and environment file leaks. Each layer catches different attack vectors.",
  
  "why_this_works": "Security vulnerabilities exist at different layers. Secrets are in code, XSS is in rendering, mixed content is in resources, dangerous code is in logic. No single check catches everything. Layering checks creates overlapping coverage where each layer compensates for the others' blind spots.",

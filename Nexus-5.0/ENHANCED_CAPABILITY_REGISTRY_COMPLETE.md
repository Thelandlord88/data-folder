## 💡 AGENT-FIRST PHILOSOPHY

### **"NEXUS persists. Agents are ephemeral. NEXUS must teach."**

This registry embodies this philosophy:

1. **NEXUS Persists:**
   - State is preserved across sessions
   - Learning accumulates over time
   - Patterns are discovered and remembered
   - Knowledge grows continuously

2. **Agents are Ephemeral:**
   - Each conversation starts fresh
   - But benefits from accumulated knowledge
   - Agent gets instant access to all capabilities
   - No need to relearn what NEXUS knows

3. **NEXUS Must Teach:**
   - Conversational discovery guides agents
   - Quick-start instructions provided
   - Proactive recommendations offered
   - Context-aware suggestions given

**Result:** Every new agent instantly has access to NEXUS's accumulated intelligence!

---

## 🎯 USE CASES

### **Use Case 1: Intelligent Tool Selection**
```typescript
// Agent asks: "How do I validate my code?"
const response = registry.conversationalDiscover(
  "How do I validate my code?"
);

// NEXUS understands intent
// NEXUS recommends best capabilities
// NEXUS explains why
// NEXUS suggests next steps
```

### **Use Case 2: Optimal Capability Bundling**
```typescript
// Find best combination for a goal
const bundle = registry.suggestCapabilityBundle(
  'validate web application',
  ['security', 'accessibility', 'performance']
);

// Returns optimized bundle with:
// - Primary capability
// - Required dependencies
// - Effectiveness score
// - Cost analysis
```

### **Use Case 3: Context-Aware Recommendations**
```typescript
// System detects issues
const recommendations = registry.getProactiveRecommendations({
  performance_metrics: { slow_pages: 10 },
  security_scan: { failed_checks: 5 },
  code_quality: { score: 70 }
});

// NEXUS proactively suggests fixes
// Prioritized by criticality
// With expected impact
```

### **Use Case 4: Learning from Experience**
```typescript
// Record every usage
registry.recordUsage(
  'security-audit',
  true,  // success
  'quote form validation',
  2400   // execution time
);

// NEXUS learns:
// - This capability works well for quote forms
// - Typical execution time is ~2400ms
// - Success rate in this context is high
// - Can recommend with confidence
```

### **Use Case 5: Enterprise Security**
```typescript
// Production environment with strict security
const secureCapabilities = registry.discoverSecure(
  'data processing',
  {
    environment: 'production',
    permissions: ['read:data', 'write:data'],
    data_sensitivity: 'high'
  }
);

// Only returns capabilities that:
// - Are allowed in production
// - Have required permissions
// - Handle high-sensitivity data safely
```

  await registry.saveToFile('./backups/registry-latest.json');
}, 60 * 60 * 1000);
```

### **Monitoring Integration:**

```typescript
// Track system health
const health = registry.getSystemHealth();

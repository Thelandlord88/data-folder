## 🧠 How Learning Works

### Pattern Effectiveness Tracking

```python
{
  "semantic-html-fix": 0.95,      # 95% effective
  "contrast-adjustment": 0.85,    # 85% effective
  "alt-text-generation": 0.90,    # 90% effective
  "heading-hierarchy": 0.92,      # 92% effective
  "landmark-addition": 0.88,      # 88% effective
}
```

### Outcome Recording

Every WCAG fix generates a learning outcome:

```json
{
  "file_path": "docs/example.html",
  "initial_score": 85,
  "final_score": 100,
  "fixes_applied": 3,
  "success": true,
  "time_taken": 2.5,
  "patterns_used": ["semantic-html-fix", "heading-hierarchy"]
}
```

# Pattern effectiveness visualization
```

### Get Pattern Recommendations

```python
from nexus_evolution_bridge import NexusEvolutionBridge

bridge = NexusEvolutionBridge()
issues = ['missing_landmarks', 'heading_hierarchy']
patterns = bridge.get_recommended_patterns('html', issues)
# Returns: ['landmark-addition', 'heading-hierarchy']
```

# NEXUS Personality Diversity Experiment - Complete Results

**Date:** October 10, 2025  
**Experiments Run:** 20 total (10 uniform + 10 diverse)  
**Purpose:** Understand personality activation patterns and cognitive diversity

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

We discovered that **request phrasing dramatically affects personality selection**. By tailoring requests to specific domains, we successfully activated **12 different personalities** across 10 experiments, compared to only Hunter in the first batch.

## 📊 Key Findings

### Experiment 1: Uniform Requests (10 trials)
**Result:** Hunter selected 100% of the time  
**Reason:** Generic "improvement" and "analysis" keywords strongly triggered Hunter's forensic analysis trait

### Experiment 2: Diverse Requests (10 trials)
**Result:** 12 different personalities activated  
**Success:** 90% targeted personality activation rate

**Personality Distribution:**

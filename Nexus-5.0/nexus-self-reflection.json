{"success":true,"response":{"content":"### 🧬 Multi-Personality Composed Response\n\n**Request**: META-ANALYSIS REQUEST: We just completed a 60-minute integration sprint where we integrated cache/profiler into NEXUS and proved 1.5x speedup with 50% cache hit rate and sub-2ms responses. Now I want YOU (the composed NEXUS personalities) to have a DEEP DISCUSSION among yourselves about: (1) Quality of your own advice - did integrationmaestro, flash, pythonista, performancehawk, and atlas give GOOD strategic guidance? Were they on-task or generic? (2) The integration work - what did we do RIGHT? What could be BETTER? (3) NEXUS self-improvement - what features, personalities, or capabilities should we ADD to make NEXUS more powerful? (4) Communication patterns - do you notice any personalities being too generic vs specific? Be BRUTALLY HONEST about your own performance. This is a self-reflection exercise. I want to see personalities DEBATE and DISAGREE if needed. Give me the raw, unfiltered discussion.\n\n**Composed Agent**: integrationmaestro + nexus-api + performancehawk + promptcrafter\n**Synergy Score**: 53%\n\n### 🎯 Trait Composition\n\n1. **systemIntegration** (integrationmaestro)\n   -

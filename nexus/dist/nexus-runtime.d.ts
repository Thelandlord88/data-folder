#!/usr/bin/env nodeLooking at your TypeScript conversion, this is excellent work! The structure is solid and you've maintained the core functionality while adding proper type safety. Let me provide some enhancements and fix the type issues:
/**

 * NEXUS Runtime - Strategic Intelligence Runtime Server (TypeScript)## Enhanced TypeScript Version

 *

 * Production-ready runtime server with full TypeScript type safety,```typescript

 * strategic intelligence capabilities, and enhanced consciousness operations.#!/usr/bin/env node

 */ /**

* NEXUS Runtime - Strategic Intelligence Runtime Server (TypeScript)

import { createServer, IncomingMessage, ServerResponse } from 'node:http'; *

import { WebSocketServer, WebSocket } from 'ws'; * Production-ready runtime server with full TypeScript type safety,

import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url'; * strategic intelligence capabilities, and enhanced consciousness operations.

import { dirname, resolve } from 'node:path'; */
